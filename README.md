# NHS App: Design styles, components and patterns

## About this repo

This is a place to test and document design styles, components and patterns being used on the NHS App.

## Building on the NHS digital service manual

The NHS App uses the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system), however it also uses many custom styles, components and patterns.

## Documenting NHS App design styles, components and patterns

We use a GitHub project board to document design styles, components and patterns being used on the NHS app, along with any work, including visual design changes, hypotheses, user insights etc. All this information then links back to the [NHS digital service manual community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1) for others to learn from the wo rk.
